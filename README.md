## How It Works

1. Products are stored as key-value pairs in a JavaScript object where keys are product names and values are prices.
2. JavaScript loops through the object and creates individual product cards using the DOM.
3. Each product card contains:
   - Item Name
   - Price
   - "Buy" and "Add to Cart" buttons
4. CSS Grid displays items in a 4-column layout (or responsive fallback).
